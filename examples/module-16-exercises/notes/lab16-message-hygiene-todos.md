# Lab 16 — Fill Message Hygiene TODOs

## Step 1 — Copy TODOs

Safe not-found message: "NOT_FOUND"\
Unsafe message anti-pattern: "http:\\postgreSQL... failed"\
Correlation always field: "lab-request-001"\
Log stack trace? yess (server logs yes/no)\
Return stack trace to client? no\
@ControllerAdvice live in this pre-lab? no\

## Step 2 — Fill blanks

Fill safe message for unknown customer, unsafe SQL/PII example, `correlationId`, yes for server logs, no for client, no for live advice.

## Step 3 — Correlation always

Write: *Every error sketch includes lab-request-001 (or request header value).*

## Step 4 — Self-check

Confirm client stack-trace blank is no.

## Scope
Pre-lab only — do not finish the full graded lab in this exercise.
